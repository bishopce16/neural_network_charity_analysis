## Results: 

Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

* Data Preprocessing
    * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
